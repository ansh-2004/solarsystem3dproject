Solar System 3D Visualization

Overview

This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system built using React Three Fiber and Three.js. It provides an interactive visualization of planets orbiting the sun with adjustable properties and configurations.

Features

3D Solar System Simulation: Realistic rendering of planets revolving around the sun.

Interactive Controls: Users can zoom, pan, and rotate using OrbitControls.

Custom Planet Configurations: Adjust planet size, orbit speed, color, and textures.

Save & Load Configurations: Save different solar system setups and load them dynamically.

Smooth Animations: Planets rotate and orbit realistically around the sun.

Technologies Used

React (Frontend Framework)

React Three Fiber (Three.js Wrapper for React)

Three.js (3D Rendering Library)

ShadCN & Tailwind CSS (Styling)

Lucide-react (Icons for UI)
